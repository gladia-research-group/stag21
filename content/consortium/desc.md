# STAG Doctoral Consortium

This year STAG 2021 will be hosting for the first time a Doctoral Consortium, addressed to all Ph.D. students in Computer Graphics and related areas. The event will take place on October 26th and 27th, 2021.

The Consortium is mainly organized by Ph.D. students. and it aims to connect young researchers in the field, providing them an exciting opportunity to share their work, experience and initiatives among fellow Ph.D. students. 
The goal in the long term is to build a stable community where you can share your research, do networking and discuss prominent topics for the Community of Computer Graphics based in Italy.

You are all invited to join. Despite the Consortium being mainly addressed to Ph.D. students, everyone interested is highly encouraged to participate, regardless of their academic position, as past and future perspectives on the Doctoral career are of fundamental value to guarantee the success of the event.
If you are willing to participate, please fill the attached form:

## Program

The Consortium will consist of two sessions according to the following schedule:

#### October 26th 10:00 AM - 12:00 AM

*Meeting session*. This time will be devoted to getting to know each other. In order to facilitate the discussion, we kindly ask you to prepare a brief presentation (about 5 minutes) to introduce yourself and your path as a Ph.D. student. You may talk about your academic experience, your research interests, or whatever you fancy. You are free and encouraged to prepare a few slides or any other kind of visual support for your presentation. 

#### October 27th 8:50 AM - 10:20 AM 

*Mentorship session*. Two senior researchers will give a talk about their career experience. The guests will be Enrico Puppo, full professor at the University of Genova, and Zorah LÃ¤hner, postDoc at the University of Siegen. A discussion will follow where we can ask questions concerning our future in industry or academia. Therefore, do not hesitate to prepare any question you like, concerning your career perspective after the Ph.D.!
