# STAG Doctoral Consortium

The STAG Doctoral Consortium is a networking event that provides Ph.D. students, working in all areas of computer graphics, with an exciting opportunity to share their work and experience among their fellow Ph.D. students.
The event aims to:

- Foster discussion and exchange of ideas in a round table, to establish  collaborations among different research groups and propose new initiatives to improve the Ph.D. experience in the long term.

- Provide participants with the opportunity of presenting their research work to an international audience, receiving feedback and mentoring, as well as a different perspective from researchers outside their home institution.
