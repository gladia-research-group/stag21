Papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair, following this [link](https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=FEfwkbFqMA43jg8XGZbx1D#). Each PDF should not exceed 10 pages in length (references excluded) and must be formatted according to the Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum publication guidelines. A LaTeX template for submitters is available here. Submitted papers will undergo a double-blind reviewing process. We therefore invite submitters to carefully remove all personal data from their articles (e.g., authors, affiliations, etc.).

STAG proceedings are published in the Eurographics Digital Library.

Authors of a selection of the best papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a **Special Issue of the Computers & Graphics Journal (Elsevier)**.



## Policies

**Double blind review**: STAG reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area reviewers of their papers, and the reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to STAG, the authors should (1) cite these papers; (2) argue in the body of your paper why your STAG paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions; and (3) include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.

**Dual/Double Submissions**: The goals of STAG are to publish exciting new work for the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers.

By submitting a manuscript to STAG, authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, no publication substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection, and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent.

A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication”.

The above definition does not consider an arXiv.org paper as a publication because it cannot be rejected. It also excludes university technical reports which are typically not peer reviewed. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in a proceedings, if their length is more than four pages (excluding citations). Given this definition, any submission to STAG should not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other concurrent submissions.

A submission with substantial overlap is one that shares 30 percent or more material with previous or concurrently submitted publications. Authors are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs about clarifications on borderline cases.

Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv.org, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered prior art and should NOT be cited in the submission.
