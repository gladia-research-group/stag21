## CONFERENCE VENUE

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the conference will be held in a virtual forum using a video conferencing platform. It is our intention to retain as much of the conference programme as is practical, including all paper presentations and keynotes.

Detailed presentation instructions will follow.
