# Call for Papers

We are pleased to invite you to submit your contribution to STAG 2021!

STAG aims to offer a forum for discussing novel ideas and results in Computer Graphics and Visual Computing. We welcome papers addressing both theoretical and application-oriented aspects of research, as well as papers describing open libraries and tools. STAG also encourages dialogue and cross-fertilization between different fields, including Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Topological Data Analysis.

Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished research papers, in the form of either long or short papers.

Long papers (not exceeding 10 pages in length, excluding references) will undergo a double-blind reviewing process. Accepted long papers will be included in the STAG proceedings, published in the Eurographics Digital Library and indexed by Scopus. The authors of selected best papers from the conference will be invited to submit extended versions to a Special Issue of the Computers & Graphics Journal (Elsevier).

Short papers (not exceeding 5 pages in length, excluding references) are expected to present ongoing research, possibly not mature enough for publication, but worth discussing with the community. The authors of accepted short papers will present their research in a dedicated session during the conference. The aim is to make the conference a meeting place between younger and experienced researchers in Computers Graphics.

Additional details can be found [here]().

STAG is an annual international conference organized by the Italian Chapter of the Eurographics association. STAG has been running continuously since 2014: this edition will be the 8th in the series, and will be held virtually.
