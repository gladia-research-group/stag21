**Smart Tools and Applications in Graphics (STAG)** is an annual international conference organized by the Italian Chapter of the Eurographics association.
We are planning to organize this event in person in Rome. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we cannot ensure it. We will update this website with all the necessary information. Please check back frequently for more details.

The aim of STAG is the dissemination of research activities and novel ideas on both theoretical and application-oriented aspects of Computer Graphics, bringing together researchers and practitioners from both national and international scientific communities to share their latest developments.
We invite contributions in the form of full papers as described on the call for papers page. The Conference will also host, as usual, the EG-Italy thesis award ceremony and for the new PhD consortium (both described in the relative pages).
