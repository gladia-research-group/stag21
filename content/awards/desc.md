# Thesis Award
STAG 2021 will host, as usual, the EG-Italy thesis award ceremony. The award is dedicated to the memory of Matteo Dellepiane, whose passion, enthusiasm, and commitment for science and computer graphics will be of inspiration for all the recipients of this prize.

The [Matteo Dellepiane](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/matteodellepiane.php) Award recognizes high-quality research thesis produced in Italian institutions. We aim to motivate young researchers, giving them the opportunity to present their works at an international scientific venue. Three awards will be granted: one for the best PhD thesis, one for the best MSc thesis, and one for the best BSc thesis.
